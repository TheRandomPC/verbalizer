{"name":"Verbalizer","tagline":"A Cross-platform Java application for Latin Students","body":"### Welcome to the Verbalizer Project Page.\r\nThis is a piece of software specifically designed for the classroom to help teach beginning Latin students the fundamentals\r\nof declining nouns and conjugating verbs in the Latin language. It consists of two modules, a conjugator and a declinator, with the declinator featuring a timer function to allow for a sort of quiz based reveal of the noun endings for the root words. A timer function is currently in the works for the conjugation. The conjugator is able to conjugate verbs in both the indicative and subjunctive moods, active and passive. The declinator is able to decline nouns in all tenses. Both the conjugator and declinator can be used with a dynamic list of nouns and verbs built into the program, or any Latin noun or verb entered manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program was originally developed as a term project for a computer science class but has since been enhanced and optimized for classroom use. The Verbalizer's design layout is based on a program written by a Latin instructor, Geoffrey Revard, whose class this program was originally indented for, in a now defunct program language for the Macintosh operating system called HyperCard. Design elements from that program have been incorporated into the design of this cross-platform Java application.\r\n\r\nThe current version of the Verbalizer is 1.0.1.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe sole programmer on this project is me, Eric Nolting (@TheRandomPC). However, as stated previous, several design aspects--as well as grammatical references--of this program came from Geoffrey Revard. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester dual majoring in Computer Science and Physics.\r\n\r\n### Contact and Bug Reporting\r\nIf you find any  bugs or Latin grammar mistakes, Please email me at nolting.eric@gmail.com with a bug report detailing the condition the bug was spotted under, and what module contained it. Thank you for your support.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
