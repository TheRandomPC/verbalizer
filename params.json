{"name":"Verbalizer","tagline":"A Cross-platform Java application for Latin Students","body":"### Welcome to the Verbalizer Project Page.\r\nThis is a piece of software specifically designed for the classroom to help teach beginning Latin students the fundamentals\r\nof declining nouns and conjugating verbs in the Latin language. It consists of two modules, a conjugator and a declinator, with the declinator featuring a timer function to allow for a sort of quiz based reveal of the noun endings for the root words. A timer function is currently in the works for the conjugation. The conjugator is able to conjugate verbs in both the indicative and subjunctive moods, active and passive. The declinator is able to decline nouns in all tenses. Both the conjugator and declinator can be used with a dynamic list of nouns and verbs built into the program, or any Latin noun or verb entered manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program was originally developed as a term project for a computer science class but has since been enhanced and optimized for classroom use. The Verbalizer's design layout is based on a program written by a Latin instructor, Geoffrey Revard, in a now defunct program language  \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
