<p>This is a piece of software specifically designed for the classroom to help teach beginning Latin students the fundamentals
of declining nouns and conjugating verbs in the Latin language. It consists of two modules, a conjugator and a declinator, with the declinator featuring a timer function to allow for a sort of quiz based reveal of the noun endings for the root words. A timer function is currently in development for the conjugator. The conjugator is able to conjugate verbs in both the indicative and subjunctive moods, active and passive. The declinator is able to decline nouns in all tenses. Both the conjugator and declinator can be used with a dynamic list of nouns and verbs built into the program, or any Latin noun or verb entered manually.</p>

<p>The program was originally developed as a term project for a computer science class but has since been enhanced and optimized for classroom use. The Verbalizer's graphical design layout is based on a program written by a Latin instructor, Geoffrey Revard, whose class this program was originally indented for, in a now defunct program language called HyperCard. Design elements from that program have been incorporated into the design of this cross-platform Java application.</p>

<p>The current version of the Verbalizer is 1.0.1.</p>

<p>The sole programmer on this project is me, Eric Nolting (<a href="https://github.com/TheRandomPC" class="user-mention">@TheRandomPC</a>). I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester dual majoring in Computer Science and Physics. However, as stated previous, several graphical design aspects--as well as grammatical references--of this program came from Geoffrey Revard.</p>
